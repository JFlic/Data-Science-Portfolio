# CovidDataProject

In this data Science Project I decided that I want'd to use the skills that I've learned in my DataBases and SQL class as well as my Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python IBM certification in a real world problem.

The real world problem that I chose was Covid19 cases that have been documented around the world.

In this project exstracted the CSV files from the Our World in Data website https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

I used Microsoft Excel to split the data into seperate Covid Deaths CSV and Covid Vaccinations CSV

Then used sqlite to make databases that I then viualized in Tableau https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jack.flickinger/viz/CovidDashboard2024/Dashboard1
