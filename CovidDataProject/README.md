# CovidDataProject

In this data Science Project I decided that I wanted to use the skills that I've learned in my Databases and SQL class as well as my Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python IBM certification in a real world problem.

The real-world problem that I chose was Covid19 cases that have been documented around the world.

In this project extracted the CSV files from the Our World in Data website https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

I used Microsoft Excel to split the data into separate Covid Deaths CSV and Covid Vaccinations CSV.

Then used SQLite to make databases that I then visualized in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jack.flickinger/viz/CovidDashboard2024/Dashboard1

The countries that are grey are the countries that are no longer sharing Covid19 health records.
